# SWML (SignalWire Markup Language)

SWML is a JSON/YAML-based language for controlling voice and video calls and messages on SignalWire. A SWML document describes a call flow — answering, playing audio, collecting input, connecting calls, joining video rooms, launching AI agents, and more. Documents can be served from a webhook or defined inline.

## Document Structure

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer
    - play: "say:Hello world"
    - hangup
```

- **version**: Semantic version string (use `"1.0.0"`)
- **sections**: Map of named sections. `main` is always executed first.
- Each section is an array of method calls executed in order.
- **Compact form**: A bare array `[...]` is treated as a single `main` section (no `version`/`sections` wrapper needed).

## Expression Evaluation

All text wrapped in `%{}` is evaluated as JavaScript:

- `%{vars.my_var}` — access script variables
- `%{call.from}` — access call object fields (read-only)
- `%{call.headers.X-Custom}` — access SIP headers
- `%{params.my_param}` — access subroutine parameters

Use `set` / `unset` methods to manage variables. Variables cannot be permanently changed inside `%{}` expressions.

## Method Format

Methods can be specified in four forms:

```yaml
# 1. Bare string (no params)
- answer

# 2. Single parameter shorthand
- play: "say:Hello"

# 3. Array parameter shorthand
- play:
    - "say:Hello"
    - "silence:1"
    - "say:Goodbye"

# 4. Object with named parameters
- play:
    urls:
      - "say:Hello"
    volume: 10
    say_voice: Polly.Matthew
```

Every method call can include an optional `label` field for use with `goto`.

## Common Patterns

### Answer and Play TTS

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer
    - play: "say:Welcome to our service. Please hold."
    - hangup
```

### IVR Menu with Digit Input

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - answer
    - label: menu
      prompt:
        play:
          - "say:Press 1 for sales, 2 for support."
        max_digits: 1
        digit_timeout: 5.0
    - switch:
        variable: prompt_value
        case:
          "1":
            - transfer: "https://example.com/sales.swml"
          "2":
            - transfer: "https://example.com/support.swml"
        default:
          - play: "say:Invalid selection."

    - connect:
        from: "+15551230000"
        to: "+15559876543"
        timeout: 30
        result:
          case:

    - answer
    - request:
        url: "https://api.example.com/lookup"
        method: POST
        headers:
          Content-Type: application/json
        body:
          caller: "%{call.from}"
    - play: "say:Your account status is %{vars.request_result}"
    - hangup
```

## Reference Lookup

This skill includes two detailed reference files in its directory:

- **`swml_reference.md`** — Full prose documentation with parameter details and examples for every SWML method (~5000 lines)
- **`schema.json`** — JSON Schema with exact types, required fields, enums, and `$defs` for every SWML structure (~12000 lines)

When you need detailed parameter information, validation rules, or exact type specifications for any SWML method, use `Grep` and `Read` to search these files in the skill directory. For example:

- To find `play` method details: `Grep` for `### play` in `swml_reference.md`
- To find the AI agent schema: `Grep` for `"ai"` in `schema.json`
- To find all parameters for `connect`: `Grep` for `### connect` in `swml_reference.md`
